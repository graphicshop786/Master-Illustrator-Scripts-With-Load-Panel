Master Illustrator Scripts With Load Panel
Master Illustrator Scripts With Load Panel is an Adobe Illustrator scripting tool that provides a non-modal, user-friendly panel for launching and managing custom .jsx scripts. With a scrollable script list, double-click execution, and robust error handling, this tool simplifies script management for designers and automation enthusiasts.
Features

Non-Modal Interface: Run scripts without closing the panel, allowing seamless execution of multiple scripts.
Scrollable Script List: Browse and select .jsx scripts from a specified folder, sorted alphabetically.
Double-Click Execution: Run scripts by double-clicking or using the "Run Selected" button.
Minimize & Restore: Minimize the panel to declutter your workspace, with instructions to reopen via Illustratorâ€™s Scripts menu.
Error Handling: Displays script errors without crashing the panel.
Resizable UI: Adjust the panel size to fit your workspace.
Portable Path Option: Easily change the script folder path for flexibility across systems.

Requirements

Adobe Illustrator: Any version supporting ExtendScript (e.g., CS6 or later, including CC).
A folder containing .jsx scripts (default: D:/Script).
Basic knowledge of Adobe Illustratorâ€™s scripting environment.

Installation

Download the Repository:

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
The main script is ScriptLauncher.jsx.


Set Up Your Script Folder:

Create a folder to store your .jsx scripts (e.g., D:/Script).
Place your custom .jsx scripts in this folder.
If you prefer a different folder, see Changing the Script Folder Path.


Run the Script Launcher:

Open Adobe Illustrator.
Go to File > Scripts > Browse and select ScriptLauncher.jsx.
The Script Launcher panel will appear, listing all .jsx scripts in the specified folder.



Usage

Launch the Panel:

Run ScriptLauncher.jsx via File > Scripts > Browse in Illustrator.
The panel displays a scrollable list of .jsx scripts in the specified folder.


Run a Script:

Select a script from the list and double-click, or click the Run Selected button.
The script will execute, and a confirmation alert will appear if successful.
If an error occurs, an alert will display the error details.


Minimize the Panel:

Click the Minimize button to hide the panel.
To reopen, rerun ScriptLauncher.jsx via File > Scripts > Browse.


Close the Panel:

Click the Close button to dismiss the panel.



Changing the Script Folder Path
By default, the Script Launcher looks for .jsx scripts in D:/Script. To use a different folder:

Open the Script:

Open ScriptLauncher.jsx in a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad, or ExtendScript Toolkit).


Modify the Path:

Locate the line:var scriptFolder = Folder("D:/Script");


Change the path to your desired folder. Examples:
Windows: var scriptFolder = Folder("C:/Users/YourName/Scripts");
Mac: var scriptFolder = Folder("~/Scripts"); (userâ€™s home directory)
Relative path: var scriptFolder = Folder(Folder.appPackage.parent + "/Scripts"); (relative to Illustratorâ€™s installation folder)




Save and Test:

Save the modified ScriptLauncher.jsx.
Ensure the new folder exists and contains .jsx scripts.
Run the script in Illustrator to verify the new path.



Tip: Use forward slashes (/) in the path, as ExtendScript handles them cross-platform.
Troubleshooting

"Folder not found" error:
Ensure the script folder (e.g., D:/Script) exists and is accessible.
Check the path in ScriptLauncher.jsx and update it if needed.


"No .jsx scripts found" error:
Verify that the folder contains .jsx files.
Ensure the files are valid ExtendScript files (not other .jsx formats, like React JSX).


Script doesnâ€™t close after running:
Check the scriptâ€™s code for modal dialogs (Window("dialog")) or infinite loops.
Replace dialog with palette or ensure the script calls window.close() or exit().
Example fix:var w = new Window("palette", "My Script");
var btn = w.add("button", undefined, "OK");
btn.onClick = function() { w.close(); };
w.show();




Panel feels unresponsive:
Ensure youâ€™re using the provided ScriptLauncher.jsx, which uses a palette window.
If a script hangs, add $.writeln("Running script: " + file.name); before $.evalFile() to debug (view logs in ExtendScript Toolkit).
